# k-mtslia
_k_-MTSLIA algorithm for arbitrary _k_.

Generalizes the 2-MTSLIA from [(McMullin, AksÃ«nova & De Santo 2019)](http://sites.rutgers.edu/lgsa/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2018/10/2MTSLIA_SCiL2019abstract_McMullinAksenovaDeSanto.pdf).

The `k_mtslia_n` version makes an assumption that no tiers will overlap. Therefore, it draws grammars from a smaller class, but might have more favorable time complexity.
